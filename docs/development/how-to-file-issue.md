# How to file an Issue

Notice an issue in our code or documentation? Is there a new feature you would like to see implemented?

Awesome!!! We welcome your input into the project.

To help with the process, we've added some Github Issue Templates to this repo.

We will want to use these templates to make sure issues are addressed and tracked.

## What is an "Issue"

In Github, "Issues" are similar to tickets or email threads, and are used to track ideas, enhancements, tasks, or bugs for work on GitHub.

You don't just create Issues, when there is a problem.

All Pull Requests should link to an Issue/s which they resolve.

## What type of Issue?

We've broken Issues into 3 main `request` types:

* Service Request - Software is not behaving as expected, aka a "bug"
* Feature Request - Suggestion to add additional behavior to software, infrastructure, or a process
* Documentation Request - Suggest better docs coverage for a particular tool or process

Please reach out in #backend slack channel or to brian @ bhgrant8@gmail.com if you feel your Issue is not addressed by one of these template types.

## Steps to Open Issue:

1. Goto: https://github.com/Pand-Aid/pandaid-api/issues and check if your concern is addressed in another open issue. *If it appears similar to a closed issue, please open a New ticket, instead of commenting on old one.*
2. Click the "New Issue" button
3. You should have a choice between the 3 types
4. Choose appropriate type to create your Issue
5. Be sure to update title, should be descriptive for easy searching
6. Fill out appropriate fields, and remove any example information.
7. Submit your Issue
8. If you need a response ASAP, post a link in #backend and we will do our best to get back promptly
