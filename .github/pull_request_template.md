## What does this do and why?

Explanation of what the ticket is accomplishing. E.g. What endpoints are you adding, why does this change need to be made, why this refactor needed, etc.

Please link to Github issue

## Additional notes for reviewers

Place for gotchas, expectations for how code changes should operate, or anything else that you would like your reviewer to know that was not covered in the “Why” section.

## Pre-Review Tasks

Place an ‘x’ between the brackets.

[ ] I wrote tests covering these changes

[ ] I reviewed my own PR before asking for review from others

[ ] I added PR comments providing additional context for reviewers where appropriate, or calling attention to especially sensitive changes.

[ ] If deps were added, I verified the licenses

## Verification steps

Commands to run unit tests locally. These should tell you what commands to run and what folder to navigate to to run the test suite.

List detailed steps required to verify your work.

How to test endpoints against the actual API (if applicable)

If needed, add links to docs with existing examples needed to test code changes. You want your reviewer to have everything they need to test out the code that you wrote.

Make them clear enough so someone unfamiliar with your work could verify for you. This is especially important for someone who is unfamiliar with the language the code is written in.

Add screenshots/gifs of success states, etc. that you expect to see.

## Screenshots (if appropriate)
